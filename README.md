UniOS
=====
A CCJam Entry
=============

UniOS is a new OS centered CraftOS, but with many GUI features as well.
Many other objects are also included in UniOS, such as a unique FS file system, and UIF (Uni Install File) support.

An API which can do many items with the OS itself, Semi-directly is also included.

Right now this isnt much, only really a plan and sketches.
Production will begin Friday-Monday, for CCJam.

Made by Patrick Zambonie.
